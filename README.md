A monorepo containing multiple React Native/Expo practice projects designed to master core concepts of mobile development. This repository serves as a learning ground for React Native and Expo, with plans to integrate backend services in the future.

## 📱 Projects

The repository currently includes the following practice projects:

- **flash-task**: A project focused on [specific concept/feature]
- **auth-box**: Authentication and user management practice
- **push-notify-me**: Push notification implementation practice

## 🛠 Tech Stack
